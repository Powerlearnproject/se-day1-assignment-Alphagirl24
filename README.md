The introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) revolutionized software development by promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
Languages like Smalltalk, C++, and later Java popularized OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
This shift led to more structured and scalable software, making development more efficient and reducing errors.
3Ô∏è‚É£ The Agile Revolution (2001-Present)

The Agile Manifesto (2001) introduced a flexible, iterative approach to software development, replacing rigid, document-heavy methodologies like the Waterfall Model.
Agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum, Kanban) emphasize continuous collaboration, rapid prototyping, and adaptability to changing requirements.
This milestone has shaped modern software engineering, enabling faster product development, better customer satisfaction, and more resilient software systems.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1Ô∏è‚É£ Requirement Analysis
